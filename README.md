# Oculus_Body_Measurement

## Overview
This project serves as a hypothetical exploration to understand how certain movements captured through a fitness application in a VR device can potentially reveal sensitive body measurements of users.

## Objective
Through analysis of the accelerometer data, I explored how such information might be used to infer personal attributes like height, arm length, and more, emphasizing the hypothetical scenario where such data is handled without user consent.

## Data Collection 
For educational purposes, this project discusses the collection of accelerometer data through a simulated fitness app on Oculus Quest 2. Users perform specific movements. I have invited my friends and also collected my data.
