# Oculus_Body_Measurement

## Overview
This project serves as a hypothetical exploration to understand how certain movements captured through a fitness application in a VR device can potentially reveal sensitive body measurements of users.

## Objective
Through analysis of the accelerometer data, I explored how such information might be used to infer personal attributes like height, arm length, and more, emphasizing the hypothetical scenario where such data is handled without user consent.

## Data Collection 
For educational purposes, this project discusses the collection of accelerometer data through a custom fitness app on Oculus Quest 2. Users perform specific movements. I have invited my friends and also collected my data.


## How to start?

Feel free to download the CSV files that contain the accelerometer data of the fitness app. This app was designed in Unity for this project. There are three CSV files for each user, one having the accelerometer data from the HMD, and the other two having the sensor data from both hand controllers separately. 

I advise you to closely examine the scatter plots as a preliminary analysis of the data to infer the movements of the users. The possible body movements that can be extracted from this data are:

- sitting height
- standing height
- arm length
- shoulder length
- upper body length
- lower body length
- maximum arm reach height
